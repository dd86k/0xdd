1. Arguments

It's possible to give direct commands to 0xdd. Note that slashes (/) can be replaced by dashes (-) for parameters. Both can work at the same time.

The order of the arguments may matter, but the last argument must be the file to open:

0xdd [/v {h|d|o}] [/w {<Number>|auto}] [/U] [/dump] <file>

/v : Define the offset view as Hexadecimal, Decimal, or Octal. Example: /v d

/w : Define the number of bytes to show in a single row. It's possible to let 0xdd automatically adjust the size with the auto option. Example: /w 8, /w a

/U : Update 0xdd. Not available.

/dump : Dump specified <file> in plain text and exit. If auto has been specified to /w, 16 will be used by defaut.

Examples:

0xdd /v d /dump NOTEPAD.EXE - Dump the data from NOTEPAD.EXE to NOTEPAD.EXE.datdmp with the decimal offset view.

2. Navigation

In 0xdd, navigation happens when a user changes the position to read of the file with a variety of keys:

Move by...
One byte: Left and right arrow keys.
One line: Up and down arrow keys.
One page: PageUp and PageDown keys.

Move to...
The beginning of the file: Home key.
The beginning of a line: To be decided.
The end of the file: End key.
A specific position: CTRL+G keys.

3. Actions

Actions, shown at the bottom, are activated by shortcuts.

^ is a short way of saying CTRL+, so ^P is interpreted as CTRL+P.

^G Goto

Go to an exact position.

By default, it will read the user's value as decimal.

Adding an 0x or 0 at the beginning will respectively read the value as hexadecimal or octal.

^W Find byte

Find an exact byte of data in either decimal, octal, or hexadecimal.

^J Find data

Find a string of data in the current file.

^D Dump

Dump the readable data under a text file encoded in UTF-8 under the datdmp extension.

^O Offset base

Change the offset base (left view) to either hexadecimal, decimal, or octal.
