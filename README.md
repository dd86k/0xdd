### Hexadecimal Console File Viewer

![0xdd](http://didi.wilomgfx.net/p/0xdd3.png)

Inspired by nano, 0xdd is a straightforward, simple, interactive, hexadecimal file viewer for Windows.

Written in C# 6.0 for .NET 4.5 with Visual Studio 2015.

Compatible with Mono, and probably compatible with Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop as well.

I do not guarantee Mono compability.

# Requirements

- .NET 4.5 (Windows) or Mono (OS X and GNU/Linux).
